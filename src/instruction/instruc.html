       <p>1. Choose the case from the dropdown as assigned by the instructor and click Start</p>
       <img class = "demoimg" src="pic1.png" alt="demo1" >
       <p>2. Choose a solvent ratio by changing the amount of CH3CN</p>
       <img class = "demoimg" src="pic2.png" alt="demo2">
       <p>3. Notice the amount of water also changes</p>
       <img class = "demoimg" src="pic3.png" alt="demo3">
       <p>4. Click Run when you have chosen a ratio combination</p>
       <img class = "demoimg" src="pic4.png" alt="demo4">
       <p>5. The chromatogram will be drawn in real time. When it is complete, hover over the peaks to see more information<br><br>
        
        6. Download the graph for later reference<br><br>
        
        7. Select Try Again if you are unhappy with the results, or Finalize Method if you are happy with the results.<br> </p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic5.png" alt="demo5">
        <p>8. To finalize your method, select the best ratio out of the ones you've tested from the drop down menu and click Submit. Use the Back Arrow to return to the solvent ratio selection page if you aren't happy with your runs.</p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic6.png" alt="demo6">
        <p>9. Once you have successfully identified the best ratio, click on each of the peaks of the graph to see the mass spectra<br></p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic7.png" alt="demo7">
        <p>10. Explore the graph by hovering over it</p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic8.png" alt="demo8">
        <p>11. Download the graph. When you are done, use the Back Arrow to return to the chromatogram of the best ratio<br><br>
            12. Click Next when you are done</p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic9.png" alt="demo9">
        <p>13. Select compounds you want to see calibration chromatograms for and click Run</p>
        <img class = "demoimg" src="pic10.png" alt="demo10">
        <p>14. Explore the chromatograms by hovering over them<br><br>

            15. Click compare to see compare the calibration curve and 
            best ratio chromatogram</p>
        <img class = "demoimg"  src="pic11.png" alt="demo11">

        <p>16. Click Try Again to return to the compound selection and 
            run more calibration trials. Once you have collected all the 
            data you need, you may move on to the data analysis.</p>
